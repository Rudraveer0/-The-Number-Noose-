# -The-Number-Noose-
The Number Noose is a dark, atmospheric horror puzzle game where players must guess a cursed number between 1 and 100 before the hangman’s noose tightens around their fate. Set in a haunted village cursed by a betrayed scholar's spirit, each wrong guess brings you closer to doom—and potentially a chilling jumpscare.
